### FAQ

**Where do I even write code?**

To do that you need a text editor. Atom is a good free one. [Download it here](https://atom.io/).

**What's a repository?**

In software development, a repository is a place where you can store a bunch of files. You can think of it as a folder or a directory.

**What's Git and all this git clone nonsense?**

Git is a way of interacting with Github via the terminal (aka. the "command line"). Commands like `git clone` let you download a repository from Github without leaving the terminal, which is a bit less faffy than downloading files and moving them about with your mouse.

**`cd`? `open index.html`?**

These are more terminal commands. `cd` means go into this folder (same as clicking on the folder). `open` is just like double clicking on a file. If you prefer you can click around to open `index.html` file, but if you learn some basics of moving around the command line you'll feel like a badass.

[Here's a good little introduction to the command line video](https://youtu.be/mT9GE3pEm8I?t=6).

**What is this html nonsense?**
